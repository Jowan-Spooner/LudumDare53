Text/11/text,There is nothing special in the trash can.
Text/12/text,"There is nothing special in the trash can, but the sound seems to be coming from behind it."
Text/13/text,"„The sound comes from outside."""
Text/14/text,The gate is locked.
Text/15/text,The gate is locked.
Text/16/text,"„The noise doesn't seem to come from there anyway."""
Text/17/text,"„She should be at home. I prefer to give it to her personally."""
Text/18/text,"„The sound is not coming from here."""
Text/19/text,"„Hey, I'm in a hurry. Just a moment."""
Text/1a/text,"I'm on the phone with my best friend. We wanted to go for a walk in the city today and talk a bit. As I leave the apartment complex, I hear a strange noise."
Text/1b/text,"„I'm sorry, but I can't make it today. I just received a visit from my parents. We will have to postpone it until next time."""
Text/1c/text,I bite my lip. This is the third time now that my best friend has canceled. I want to say something...but we're best friends!
Choice/1d/text,But I have to say something!
Choice/1d/disabled_text,
Text/1e/text,"„Uh, do you know..."""
Text/1f/text,"„Yes, I'll be right there! What's the matter, {mc}?"""
Text/20/text,I sigh softly and shake my head.
Text/21/text,"„No, no... all good."""
Choice/22/text,I choose to remain silent.
Choice/22/disabled_text,
Text/23/text,"„I'm really sorry, but tomorrow is definitely the day!"""
Text/24/text,"I hear that she's sorry, but I still hesitate. Tomorrow, I was actually planning to take a break and have some time for myself..."
Text/25/text,"„Alright then, see you tomorrow!"""
Text/26/text,"„Yes, then tomorrow. Well, have a good time today!"""
Text/27/text,"I agree hurriedly and after a brief farewell, I feel a bit frustrated. Strange noises don't improve my mood, and I turn in the direction they're coming from."
Text/28/text,"„What is that?"""
Text/29/text,"After taking a few steps towards the package and examining it more closely, I discover that it's ripped open and contains a gift. After carefully examining the package, I'm able to decipher the address and recipient name."
Text/2a/text,"„Oh, Ak…b..n... oh, this is surely for Mrs. Akoban. Since I have nothing to do today, I can bring it to her right away."""
Text/2b/text,"I pick up the package and set off. I'm sure I can bring some joy to my neighbor. After the breakup with her ex, he seemed to retaliate with childish behavior by not delivering her mail properly."
Text/2c/text,"„Hello {mc}, nice to see you. Since when do you deliver packages?“"
Text/2d/text,"I notice how she glances at the package and is visibly surprised. As soon as we make brief eye contact, she turns away hurriedly and tries to look at the package."
Text/2e/text,"„Hi Miu, the package is for you. It was by the trash cans...“"
Text/2f/text,I explain slowly and see how she hesitantly approaches. She takes the package and looks at the address before shaking her head and peering inside.
Text/30/text,"„That's not mine. I think it belongs to Mr. Akuban. He moved away quite some time ago, and there have been mix-ups with our last names before.“"
Text/31/text,I nod slowly in understanding and have to strain myself to continue listening to her. She always speaks a little quieter than the others.
Text/32/text,„Then you can probably bring it to him. I don't know him..“
Text/33/text,My neighbor shook her head.
Text/34/text,"„I'd like to, but I don't know anything more than his last name. But it would be a shame if he didn't get his package today..."""
Text/35/text,„I heard his wife left him... Maybe I shouldn't go to the birthday party today and try to find him instead..“
Choice/36/text,"I could take care of it. After all, I don't have anything planned."
Choice/36/disabled_text,
Choice/37/text,I don't actually plan on delivering the package.
Choice/37/disabled_text,
Text/38/text,It's better if I slowly withdraw.
Text/39/text,"„Miu, I have to go now.“"
Text/3a/text,"„O- o- of course, see you later, {mc}.“"
Text/3b/text,"I see Miu weakly lift her hand, take out her phone and start typing. She's clearly down, and I feel very guilty."
Text/3c/text,I turn around and ball my fists. Miu has been through enough. She should think of herself today.
Text/3d/text,"I turn around and walk towards Miu, who blinks in surprise."
Text/3e/text,"„Leave it to me. I have nothing planned today, and if he's that well-known, it should be possible to find him quickly.“"
Text/3f/text,Miu beams from ear to ear.
Text/40/text,"„Thank you so much, {mc}. I heard an old friend of his sells cars on Lessingstraße. Maybe he can help you more. But is this really okay for you?“"
Text/41/text,"„Yes, of course. ""I'll go now.“"
Text/42/text,"I take the package back and feel her touch my arm gently. I look up at her, and she quickly withdraws her hand."
Text/43/text,„I'm sorry for burdening you with this. I know you're busy too.“
Text/44/text,I smile gratefully and walk away.
Text/45/text,"It's always clear to me that Miu is a very attentive person. That's why I don't want to burden her with anything more. She's always considerate of others, and today she deserves to have a nice day. Actually, I can't take much off her plate, even though she's always so accommodating as a neighbor. Delivering a package is an easy task, after all."
Text/46/text,"As soon as I arrive, I spot a few cars that are clearly not in my price range. Nonetheless, I can't take my eyes off some of them.
The package is getting heavier and I wonder if I should put it down."
Choice/47/text,I put down the package
Choice/47/disabled_text,
Text/48/text,"As soon as I put it down, I felt somewhat freer and stretch a bit."
Choice/49/text,I kept the package in my arms
Choice/49/disabled_text,
Text/4a/text,I decide to continue carrying the package to prevent myself or someone else from tripping over it.
Text/4b/text,"„Welcome to Autohaus KING, where we make driving a real experience.“"
Text/4c/text,"I jump as the salesman suddenly walks past me and stands in front of me. In doing so, he trips over the package. After a brief stumble, he regains his balance and starts talking."
Text/4d/text,I pick up the package again and notice that the salesman is making sure he is visible.
Text/4e/text,I jump as the salesman suddenly walks past me and stands in front of me. He makes sure the package does not cover him too much.
Text/4f/text,"„I'm your man today, not just any salesman, but your friend who wants to sell you only the best of the best.“"
Text/50/text,"I am about to say something, but the salesman is already pointing at a red sports car."
Text/51/text,"„That is your car, the latest model that you can pay for in installments. But wait, I can see that's not your thing. But don't worry, I'll find the perfect car for you.“"
Text/52/text,"I open my mouth to say something, but he interrupts me right away."
Text/53/text,„These days there are so many cars and uncertainties. You clearly belong to the type of people who want it a little safer. Just follow me..“
Text/54/text,"I follow him reluctantly, but I don't want to be rude either. This is at least my chance to say something!"
Text/55/text,„I am actually here because of the package. It's for a Mr. Akuban.“
Text/56/text,"„Of course, you are a delivery person. Then I have the perfect vehicle for you.“"
Text/57/text,I sigh quietly and clear my throat. This can't be true! I just want to deliver the package!
Text/58/text,"„This is our compact car. Very handy, a bit older, but it has all the tires and has always been serviced in the workshop. Exactly the right car for you. Look at the price. A real bargain!“"
Text/59/text,I look at the price and hesitate for a moment.
Choice/5a/text,I think I'll take the car!
Choice/5a/disabled_text,
Text/5b/text,„Then I might as well drive to Mr. Akuban's with it!“
Text/5c/text,The salesman suddenly smiled broadly as soon as I agreed.
Text/5d/text,"„Wonderful, then we can conclude the contract right away!“"
Text/5e/text,"Barely out of the office, I suddenly feel much worse. I now have the address and my own car, but something in me says I will regret it in the next few years. Is it because of the strange fine print?"
Text/5f/text,"Although I now have a car, I can't use it. Apparently, the salesman wants to take the car back to the workshop again, so I have to walk to the bar."
Choice/60/text,I won't take the car.
Choice/60/disabled_text,
Text/61/text,"„Thanks, but I'm not interested in the car.“"
Text/62/text,"„Okay, then maybe-"""
Text/63/text,„NO!“
Text/64/text,"„I'm not interested in the car, but I need to find Mr. Akuban. Can you tell me where he is or do you not know him?"""
Text/65/text,The salesman purses his lips and lets out a heavy sigh.
Text/66/text,„Are you really not willing to buy a car?“
Text/67/text,"„Listen, if this keeps going on like this...!“"
Text/68/text,"He quickly raises his hands and puts on his brightest smile. In that moment, I feel the overwhelming desire to wipe it off his face."
Text/69/text,"„Mr. Akuban is a good friend. He works at the bar which is not very far from here. A good man, that guy. Say hello to him from me. You just go straight from here and take the third left. You can't miss the bar.“"
Text/6a/text,„Thank you very much.“
Text/6b/text,I said goodbye and felt very relieved to be getting away from this man. Buying a car had suddenly become much less attractive than I had thought.
Text/6c/text,"WIP
(You won the sorting game)"
Text/6d/text,"I decided to approach the bartender and ask for Mr. Akuban. The closer I got to the bar, the more unsure I became."
Text/6e/text,"„Shut up, Ciper, drink your crap and get lost.“"
Text/6f/text,"The bartender said, and I flinched slightly. I sat down at the bar and placed the package as close to me as possible."
Text/70/text,"„What do you want here, kiddo??“"
Text/71/text,„I'm looking for a Mr. Akuban... so...“
Text/72/text,I was interrupted as the bartender looked at me with a cold and downright creepy gaze.
Text/73/text,"„Get out of here, you have no business here.“"
Text/74/text,I quickly understood that he didn't want to talk to me. So I had to make sure he would talk to me!
Text/75/text,Mr. Akuban seemed much friendlier all of a sudden after I made an effort to show him that I was serious.
Text/76/text,"„They call me Boris here. Drop the 'Mr.' What do you want, kiddo?“"
Text/77/text,"„I'm here because of the package, it's for you..“"
Text/78/text,"I pushed the package over to him and after he had inspected and unpacked it, he looked at me for a while. Finally, he slammed his hand on the counter, which completely confused me."
Text/79/text,„Damn witch! Wait a minute.“
Text/7a/text,"He said and disappeared shortly after. When he came back, he had a small card and a note with him. The note had an address and directions, while the card was clearly a birthday card."
Text/7b/text,"„I would be very grateful if you could bring my niece's gift. Actually, I didn't want to take the witch's gift, but since you made an effort to earn my respect, I'll turn a blind eye."""
Text/7c/text,"He seemed sulky, but continued speaking."
Text/7d/text,"„My niece has her birthday today... please let her know that I'll come by later. Unfortunately, I have to stay in this place longer today.“"
Text/7e/text,"I was surprised by his words and couldn't possibly refuse. Boris wasn't a bad guy, and since I had already taken the whole way, I might as well go the last few meters."
Text/7f/text,I packed the gift and the card and said goodbye to the group.
Text/80/text,"„Get lost."""
Text/81/text,"As I finally reached the bar, the smell of alcohol and smoke hit me, and I noticed some of the guests staring at me."
Text/82/text,"""Hey don't touch it."""
Text/83/text,Maybe he will talk to me when I help him.
Text/84/text,"""Hey Boris can I help you out by sorting the shelf?"""
Text/85/text,"""Fine. If you sort them well I will awnser any question your have."""
Text/86/text,What is your name?
Text/87/text,"I am actually glad that I don't have to carry the big package anymore, but only the gift and the attached card. That makes things much easier!"
Text/88/text,"Slowly but surely, I approach the address. I hear children's laughter, but also a few screams of joy. Children can be very peculiar at times."
Text/89/text,"After I reach the house, I see how much is decorated. Children are running around, but one of the children looks particularly sad and is standing around watching the others."
Text/8a/text,I approach the girl who looks at me questioningly.
Text/8b/text,"„So, I don't know you.“"
Text/8c/text,„I'm {mc}. I'm here because I have a very important delivery for the birthday girl!“
Text/8d/text,"„I'm the birthday girl, I'm Lara and I'm already 7 years old today.“"
Text/8e/text,"Proudly, the girl raises her hands to show the number on her fingers. Instantly, she looks at the gift and seems very excited."
Text/8f/text,"„Your uncle and aunt both wanted me to deliver this to you, and your uncle even gave me a card for you. Unfortunately, he will be a little late.“"
Text/90/text,"„As long as he comes, it's not a problem!“"
Text/91/text,„Is this... the gift they chose for me?“
Text/92/text,I see how the girl keeps looking at the wrapped gift and hand her the package along with the card.
Text/93/text,Thank you so much! You saved my birthday!
Text/94/text,"The girl hurries to unwrap the present, and a teddy bear comes into view which she hugs tightly. It doesn't take long before she runs off and is more excited than any other child. I am very happy to see her like that, and don't regret taking the package from Mia."
Text/95/text,"„Isn't that you, {mc}?“"
Text/96/text,"„Mia, what are you doing here?“"
Text/97/text,„I t- t- told you I was invited to a birthday party. And you? Did you succeed with the package?“
Text/98/text,"I nod, and suddenly I hear a honk. I look with Mia to the entrance and see the vendor getting out of a car. I can also see Boris. He goes straight to Lara, who greets him."
Text/99/text,"„Wait, does that mean... Oh no, I'm so sorry, {mc}, I didn't know...“"
Text/9a/text,I shake my head and smile.
Text/9b/text,"„Don't worry. Today, at least, I wasn't bored. And you know what? I think we can definitely do things together more often and solve your problem with your ex.“"
Text/9c/text,"I don't know why, but I have the feeling that something has changed in me through this small delivery, and I want to continue this change!"
Text/9d/text,"I am actually glad that I don't have to carry the big package anymore, but only the gift and the attached card. That makes things much easier!"
Text/9e/text,"Slowly but surely, I approach the address. I hear children's laughter, but also a few screams of joy. Children can be very peculiar at times."
Text/9f/text,"After I reach the house, I see how much is decorated. Children are running around, but one of the children looks particularly sad and is standing around watching the others."
Text/a0/text,I approach the girl who looks at me questioningly.
Text/a1/text,"„So, I don't know you.“"
Text/a2/text,„I'm {mc}. I'm here because I have a very important delivery for the birthday girl!“
Text/a3/text,"„I'm the birthday girl, I'm Lara and I'm already 7 years old today.“"
Text/a4/text,"Proudly, the girl raises her hands to show the number on her fingers. Instantly, she looks at the gift and seems very excited."

Text/a6/text,"„As long as he comes, it's not a problem!“"
Text/a7/text,„Is this... the gift they chose for me?“
Text/a8/text,I see how the girl keeps looking at the wrapped gift and hand her the package along with the card.
Text/a9/text,Thank you so much! You saved my birthday!
Text/aa/text,"The girl hurries to unwrap the present, and a teddy bear comes into view which she hugs tightly. It doesn't take long before she runs off and is more excited than any other child. I am very happy to see her like that, and don't regret taking the package from Mia."
Text/ab/text,"„Isn't that you, {mc}?“"
Text/ac/text,"„Miu, what are you doing here?“"
Text/ad/text,„I t- t- told you I was invited to a birthday party. And you? Did you succeed with the package?“
Text/ae/text,I nod and suddenly hear a honk. I look with Mia to the entrance and see the vendor getting out of my car. I can also see Boris. He goes straight to Lara who greets him.
Text/af/text,I shake my head and smile.
Text/b0/text,"„Wait, does that mean... Oh no, I'm so sorry, {mc}, I didn't know...“"
Text/b1/text,"„Don't worry. Today, at least, I wasn't bored. And you know what? I think we can definitely do things together more often and solve your problem with your ex.“"
Text/b2/text,"I don't know why, but I have the feeling that something has changed in me through this small delivery, and I want to continue this change!"
Text/b3/text,The only thing I would still like to avoid is buying a car from that sleazy car dealer. It's constantly breaking down!
